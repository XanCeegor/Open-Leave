# Open Leave

Open Leave is an AD LDAP integrated leave system based on leave accrual created to be used alongside an Active Directory system. User details are synchronized from AD into a local database without users needing to create user accounts first. User details can also be modified in AD directly without needing to log into the system itself.
Uses the ADLDAP2 for Laravel package. (https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2-Laravel)
